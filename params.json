The discovery of skyrmions in magnetic materials and of their self-organisation into a skyrmion lattice has made skyrmion physics arguably the hottest topic in magnetism.\r\n\r\nThe project is led by Prof. Peter Hatton & Dr.Tom Lancaster (Durham), Prof. Paul Midgley FRS (Cambridge), Prof. Thorsten Hesjedahl (Oxford), Prof. Hans Fangohr & Dr. Ondrej Hovorka (Southampton), Prof. Geetha Balakrishnan & Prof. Don Paul (Warwick). We are launching a major research programme intended to achieve a step-change in our understanding of skyrmions in magnetic materials and engineer them towards application. Our EPSRC-funded programme is a six-year UK based project built around a consortium of five premier Universities, with input from international academic institutions and industrial partners.\r\n\r\nWe are recruiting five three-year Post Doctoral Research Associates to the project, one based in each University. We require expertise in (i) crystal growth and characterisation (ii) state-of-the-art experimentation (iii) thin film physics (iv) electron microscopy and (v) computational modelling.We will also shortly be recruiting PhD students at each institution.\r\nFor enquiries about the project contact Prof. Peter D. Hatton (p.d.hatton@durham.ac.uk).\r\n\r\nMore detailed information for the available posts:\r\n\r\n- Durham (to be announced)\r\n- Cambridge (to be announced)\r\n- Oxford (to be announced)\r\n- [Southampton, Computational Modelling](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/vacancies/programmegrant.html)\r\n- Warwick (to be announced)\r\n\r\n![A Skyrmion](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/gallery/2015-skyrmion-povray.png)",
